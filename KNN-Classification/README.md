# KNN Classification on Iris Dataset
We will follow these steps:

● Load and preprocess data (normalize features)
● Split into training and testing sets

● Train KNN model on the training data

● Make predictions on the test set

● Evaluate performance (accuracy)

● Plot decision boundaries and classification results

● Experiment with different K values and compare results

● Find the relationship between accuracy and the number of neighbors (k), with experiments

● Find the relationship between k and training set size, with experiments
